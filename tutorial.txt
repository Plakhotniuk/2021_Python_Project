Hello there!
Are you ready to explore outer space on your brand new spaceship?
Lets’s do this!

To start your exciting journey first of all you need to set the parameters for:
1. Pulse
2. Angle
3. Engine run time
4. Time of the calculation
5. Time factor
You need them to calculate the direction and trajectory of the ship.
 In order to do so you need to write the digits in boxes for Pulse,
 Engine run time, Time of calculations, set the Angle using the slider,
 choose the coefficient for the Time factor.

Want to see the full picture?
Use UP/DOWN arrow keys if you want zoom IN/OUT
Use W/A/S/D keys to move the camera around.

All the parameters are set and you are ready to take off?
Press ‘CALCULATE’ to see the trajectory
(red arrow shows the calculated trajectory,
gray arrow shows the direction of current velocity) and then press ‘START’.
Have fun!
